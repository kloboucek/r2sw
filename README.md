# Rebel 2 Switchwire clone

Rebel2 3D printer to Voron Switchwire conversion

Rebel2 is a czech republic very own, community based 3D printer project that was very popular back in around 2014. It was fairly cheap and quite easy to build machine and as any other DIY/open source style 3D printer, it was also highly mod-able :-)

Here's one ...mine... as I got it from my good friend... it was pretty good trade, two bottles of gin for a 3D printer :-)
