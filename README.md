# Rebel 2 Switchwire clone

Rebel2 3D printer to Voron Switchwire conversion

Rebel2 is a czech republic very own, community based 3D printer project that was very popular back in around 2014. It was fairly cheap and quite easy to build machine and as any other DIY/open source style 3D printer, it was also highly mod-able :-)

Here's one ...mine... as I got it from my good friend... it was pretty good trade, two bottles of gin for a 3D printer :-)

Well, take it with a grain of salt, this was my very first 3D printer and the date was sometime in 2022, little late to the party, but still happy to have joined!! 

Over next year and a half, many things had happened to this machine, first came necessary fixes as it wasn't fully operational when I brought it home. Missing Z driver was the main culprit at the time, but hey, took me a little while to diagnose that since again, it was the very first 3D printer I got my hands on :-)

Years passed, motors turned a lot... then I discovered the Vorons family... oh boy, I shouldn't have... but I did and am still loving it! Decided to build a self-sourced Trident and so I did that over the course of roughly 6 months and then ...does it happen to you all too, you get one 3D printer, sooner or later you want to build another one and as if two were not enough, the urge to build a third printer is starting to crawl from the back of the mind... you know where I'm going to with this, don't you?

And in the meantime, R2 was getting some serious upgrades, every single plastic part got replaced, probably twice if I remember well. Z motors got replaced with new ones with integrated trapeziod rods, X & Y motors got replaced with ones with higher torque / amps, then the old LCD got replaced with newer BTT mini style LCD and so on... of course the toolhead didn't go abandonded, that got replaced as well at least three times... the final one, that's still on there is the Dragon Burner.

And so then another idea was born... to continue the path to better layers in every direction, mostly Z, I decided to mod this machine to become the ...most likely... very first <b>Rebel2SW clone</b>.

This repository is just for anyone who owns Rebel2 printer and is a DIY person day and night... STLs are in the folder already, most of it is funtional. The only thing that's not been tested are the plexi panels - I added the support structure, which I have printed and mounted to the machine (photo to be added), but I haven't ordered the plexi glass yet. I will add dxf files for each plexi glass, but it will be sort of "at your own risk" for the time being.
